## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open the project in Godot.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use the arrow keys to move the player.
2. Touching an enemy will restart the scene.
3. There are four areas.
4. That's everything, because this is just a tech demo.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- I actually used a fork of the Godot engine called [Redot](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine), although the project should run in the real Godot as well.
